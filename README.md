# CNN Plant Disease Classifier

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based plant disease classifier implemented using TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify plant images into three categories: "Healthy", "Powdery", and "Rust". The dataset consists of 1530 images divided into training, testing, and validation sets.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Plant Disease Recognition Dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of plant diseases categorized into "Healthy," "Powdery," and "Rust" conditions. The dataset consists of 1530 images divided into training, testing, and validation sets.
